### To Do

1. List all types of instances both AWS and local infra
2. List all pipelines
3. Create Ovpn files to connect through internal network

For each type of instance -

1. Check deployment pipeline
2. Docker file or helm chart
3. Mounted volumes
4. Network configurations
5. Database configurations

### 2.1 Infrastructure Review

#### 2.1.1 AWS Review

1. **Inventory AWS Resources**:

   - Use AWS Config and Resource Groups to list all resources.
   - Categorize resources by type (e.g., EC2, S3, RDS, VPC).

2. **Examine EC2 Instances**:

   - Review instance types, security groups, and associated IAM roles.
   - Check for autoscaling groups and load balancers.

3. **Review S3 Buckets**:

   - Check bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs).
   - Identify storage classes and lifecycle policies.

4. **IAM Roles and Policies**:

   - Audit IAM roles, policies, and user permissions.
   - Use IAM Access Analyzer for insights on permissions.

5. **VPC and Network Configuration**:

   - Review VPC configurations, subnets, route tables, and NAT gateways.
   - Check security groups and network ACLs.

6. **RDS Instances**:
   - Review database configurations, backup policies, and performance metrics.
   - Check for Multi-AZ deployments and read replicas.

#### 2.1.2 Kubernetes Review

1. **Cluster Configuration**:

   - Document the cluster setup, including version, nodes, and network policies.
   - Use tools like `kubectl` and `kubeadm` to gather cluster information.

2. **Namespaces and Resource Quotas**:

   - Review existing namespaces and their resource quotas.
   - Understand the purpose and usage of each namespace.

3. **Deployments and Services**:

   - List all deployments, stateful sets, and daemon sets.
   - Document services, including type (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer) and endpoints.

4. **ConfigMaps and Secrets**:

   - Review ConfigMaps and Secrets to understand configurations and sensitive data handling.
   - Check for proper encryption of secrets.

5. **Ingress and Egress Policies**:
   - Document Ingress controllers and rules.
   - Review network policies for ingress and egress traffic control.

#### 2.1.3 Docker Review

1. **Dockerfiles and Images**:

   - Review Dockerfiles for best practices and security issues.
   - Document the process for building and storing Docker images.

2. **Container Orchestration**:
   - Understand how containers are orchestrated within Kubernetes.
   - Review configurations for container scaling, self-healing, and updates.

### 2.2 Audit and Monitoring Tools

1. **Assess Monitoring Setup**:

   - Review the current monitoring tools in use (e.g., CloudWatch, Prometheus, Grafana).
   - Ensure dashboards and alerts are documented and understood.

2. **Logging Systems**:

   - Check logging configurations and tools (e.g., ELK stack, Fluentd).
   - Review log retention policies and access controls.

3. **Alerting Mechanisms**:
   - Document existing alerting rules and notification channels.
   - Validate the relevance and actionability of alerts.

### 2.3 Access and Security Review

1. **Access Controls**:

   - Review current access control mechanisms (e.g., IAM policies, security groups).
   - Ensure access is granted based on the principle of least privilege.

2. **Security Audits**:

   - Perform security audits using tools like AWS Trusted Advisor and Kubernetes security benchmarks.
   - Document findings and remediation plans.

3. **Compliance Checks**:
   - Ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations (e.g., GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation).
   - Document compliance status and audit reports.

### Detailed Steps and Approach for Understanding Existing Infrastructure

#### Step 1: Gather Existing Documentation

- Collect all existing documentation, including architecture diagrams, configuration files, and previous runbooks/playbooks.
- Identify gaps in documentation and areas that need updating or creation.

#### Step 2: Conduct Training Sessions

- Organize workshops with outgoing team members to walk through the infrastructure setup.
- Use these sessions to clarify doubts and capture undocumented knowledge.

#### Step 3: Perform a Hands-On Audit

- New team members should perform a hands-on review of the infrastructure.
- Use audit tools and scripts to verify configurations and settings.

#### Step 4: Create Detailed Documentation

- Document findings from the audit in detail.
- Update architecture diagrams to reflect the current state of the infrastructure.
- Ensure all configurations, policies, and procedures are well-documented.

#### Step 5: Implement a Knowledge Base

- Create a centralized knowledge base (e.g., Confluence) to store all documentation.
- Ensure the knowledge base is easily accessible and regularly updated.

#### Step 6: Set Up Regular Review Meetings

- Schedule regular meetings to review and update documentation.
- Use these meetings to discuss any changes in the infrastructure and ensure everyone is on the same page.

### Proven Approaches

1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:

   - Use IaC tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, or Ansible to define and document infrastructure.
   - Ensure all infrastructure changes are tracked and version-controlled.

2. **Peer Reviews**:

   - Implement peer review processes for any changes to the infrastructure.
   - Use code reviews and pair programming to share knowledge and ensure quality.

3. **Automated Documentation**:
   - Use tools that automatically generate documentation from code and configurations (e.g., Terraform-docs, Kubernetes-DocGen).
   - Ensure documentation is updated as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
