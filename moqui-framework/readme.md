TODO: Define a training document and assignment on 
Extending Entity in Moqui / OFBiz. Compile challenge questions that lead to learning best practices. 
We should check our repo. 
If we have extended fields in Moqui Order Data model , Then we can add that in place of made up situation in one of the tasks in assignment.

TODO: Common training element for all roles.
I am sure we have training document on  "Writing commit log".

What is considered as managed skill?
Skill set is a graph. Right? Fundamental skills are at leaf level or closer to leaf level. Then developer builds skills that depend on other skills. 

Something is managed skills if it can be defined as a node on skillset tree.

As we design our training program it's important that we manage the effort. 
To keep the trainee interest, we have to offer something at the end, it also helps/forces to define finish line. 
To define finish line, we have to define domain of the skill.

Our training program should,  Help developer to learn it and we should have Assignment to test the skill. The learning process has two parts,
-- Online tutorial
-- Experience, write real life tasks. 
-- Start with Why

The training material we have defined so far, in the spreadsheet mentioned earlier in this chat is considered at fundamental skill.
Once developer has passed this stage, they can pick smaller but well defined skill that we need once in while

Like Data Document, SystemMessageRemote feature of Moqui (we need to call this by appropriate name) is other skills that might qualify for Independently managed moqui platform skill
