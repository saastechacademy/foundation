### Activity 1: Java Timeline and Major Milestones

**Objective:** Create a detailed timeline that highlights major milestones in Java's development from its inception to 2004. This should include the release of major versions, introduction of key technologies, and pivotal moments in Java's history.

**Tasks:**
- Research the history of Java, focusing on its origins, the problems it aimed to solve, and its initial public reception.
- Identify and document the release dates of major Java versions (Java 1.0 through to Java 5.0) and describe the key features introduced in each version.
- Highlight significant technological advancements (e.g., applets, servlets, J2EE, J2ME) and their impact on development practices and industry standards.

### Activity 2: Deep Dive into Java Technologies

**Objective:** Conduct a series of deep dives into specific Java technologies, frameworks, and APIs that were significant up to 2004. Each intern (or group of interns) will focus on one area, researching its development, use cases, and impact.

**Tasks:**
- **Applets and Web Start:** Explore the use of Java applets in early web development, their capabilities, security concerns, and eventual decline with the rise of modern web technologies. Include a practical task of creating a simple applet.
- **Servlets and JSP:** Investigate how Java moved to the server side with servlets and JSP. Create a simple web application using servlets and JSP to understand their interaction and functionality.
- **J2EE Components:** Each intern/group selects a J2EE component (EJB, JMS, JTA, etc.) to research and present on its architecture, use cases, and how it contributed to enterprise application development. Optionally, develop a small demo that utilizes the selected component.
- **Java Performance Enhancements:** Study the evolution of Java's performance, focusing on JVM improvements, garbage collection mechanisms, and benchmarks. Analyze the performance changes between two Java versions using a simple Java application.

### Activity 3: Security in Java

**Objective:** Examine the evolution of security features and mechanisms in Java, identifying key vulnerabilities and how they were addressed over time.

**Tasks:**
- Compile a report on Java's security model, including its sandbox environment, access controllers, and cryptographic APIs.
- Research and document notable security vulnerabilities in Java's history and how subsequent updates addressed these issues.

### Activity 4: Community and Ecosystem Impact

**Objective:** Analyze the role of the Java Community Process (JCP), open-source projects, and the developer community in the evolution of Java.

**Tasks:**
- Investigate the formation and function of the JCP. Discuss its impact on Java's development through community involvement.
- Select an open-source project or tool developed in Java (up to 2004) and study its development history, community engagement, and impact on the Java ecosystem.

### Activity 5: Presentation and Panel Discussion

**Objective:** Share findings and insights from the research and practical activities with peers and mentors through presentations and a panel discussion.

**Tasks:**
- **Presentation:** Each intern or group prepares a presentation on their assigned topics, highlighting key findings, insights, and personal learning experiences.
- **Panel Discussion:** Host a panel discussion with all participants to debate the evolution of Java, its impact on software development, and lessons learned from its history. Prepare specific topics or questions to guide the discussion.
