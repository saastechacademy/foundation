### Key Figures in Java's Development:

#### 1. **James Gosling:** Often referred to as the "Father of Java," Gosling's vision and original design of Java laid the foundation for its future. 
- **Activity:** Research James Gosling's background, his role in the creation of Java, and his contributions to its early versions. Explore his motivations for creating Java and how his decisions shaped the language.

#### 2. **Patrick Naughton:** As one of the original members of the Java project team (also known as the "Green Team"), Naughton played a significant role in Java's early development.
- **Activity:** Investigate Patrick Naughton's contributions to Java, focusing on the development of the Java language and its initial applications.

#### 3. **Mike Sheridan:** Alongside Gosling and Naughton, Sheridan was part of the initial team that started the Java project at Sun Microsystems.
- **Activity:** Examine Mike Sheridan's role in the conceptualization and launch of the Java project. Discuss how his contributions helped in positioning Java within Sun Microsystems and the broader tech industry.

#### 4. **Bill Joy:** A co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Joy was instrumental in Java's development and its adoption as a critical technology for the company.
- **Activity:** Study Bill Joy's involvement in Java, especially his role in envisioning the future of Java and his influence on its design and features.

#### 5. **Guy L. Steele Jr.:** Known for his work on defining the syntax and semantics of Java.
- **Activity:** Research Guy L. Steele Jr.'s contributions to the Java language specification. Explore how his expertise in programming languages influenced Java's design decisions.

### Groups and Organizations:

#### 1. **Sun Microsystems:** The company where Java was born. Its support and promotion of Java were crucial to its success.
- **Activity:** Analyze Sun Microsystems' role in developing and marketing Java. Look into how the company's strategies, leadership, and vision contributed to Java's growth.

#### 2. **Oracle Corporation:** After acquiring Sun Microsystems in 2010, Oracle took over Java's development. While this is beyond the project's timeline, understanding Oracle's acquisition can provide context for Java's history.
- **Activity:** Briefly research the impact of Oracle's acquisition of Sun Microsystems on Java, focusing on the transition period and immediate changes.

#### 3. **Java Community Process (JCP):** An organizational body that guides the development of Java.
- **Activity:** Investigate the formation of the JCP and its role in Java's evolution. Highlight significant contributions by community members and how the JCP has influenced Java's development.

### Suggested Activities for Research on Key Figures:

- **Biographical Essays:** Write detailed essays on each key figure, covering their background, contributions to Java, and the impact of their work on the language's evolution.
- **Interview Analysis:** Where possible, analyze interviews and talks given by these individuals to gain insights into their perspectives on Java's development and its future directions.
- **Contribution Case Studies:** Create case studies on specific contributions by these figures, such as the development of key Java features or pivotal decisions in Java's design philosophy.
