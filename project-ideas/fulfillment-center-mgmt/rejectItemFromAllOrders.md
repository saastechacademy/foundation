### **rejectItemFromAllOrders**

The `rejectItemFromAllOrders` service in the `StoreFulfillmentEvents.txt` file is designed to reject a specific product from all orders within a given facility where it's part of an in-progress shipment. This action is typically taken when a product is found to be defective, unavailable, or needs to be removed from pending fulfillments due to other reasons.

**Key points and logic:**

1.  **Input Parameters:**
    *   `productId` (String): The unique identifier of the product to be rejected.
    *   `facilityId` (String): The ID of the facility from which the product should be rejected.
    *   `userLogin` (GenericValue): The userLogin object representing the user initiating the rejection.
    *   `reasonId`: The ID of the reason for the rejection (e.g., "DAMAGED," "INCORRECT\_ITEM").

2.  **Identifying Shipments:**
    *   The service queries the database to find all shipments within the specified facility that meet the following criteria:
        *   The shipment is in progress (either `SHIPMENT_APPROVED` or `SHIPMENT_INPUT` status).
        *   The shipment contains the specified `productId`.

3.  **Iterating and Rejecting:**
    *   For each identified shipment:
        *   The associated order (`OrderHeader`) is retrieved.
        *   The order's status is checked to ensure it's in a cancelable state (not canceled, completed, or rejected).
        *   If the order is cancelable, the `rejectShipmentItem` service is called to reject the specific product item from that shipment. The following parameters are passed to `rejectShipmentItem`:
            *   `shipmentId`
            *   `shipmentItemSeqId`
            *   `quantity`
            *   `reasonId`
            *   `rejectionComments` (set to "Store Rejected Inventory")

**Error Handling:**

*   The service includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential exceptions during database queries and service calls. If an error occurs, it logs the error and returns an error message.

**Key Use Cases:**

*   **Product Recall:** When a product needs to be recalled due to safety or quality concerns.
*   **Product Discontinuation:** When a product is no longer available and should not be shipped.
*   **Inventory Discrepancy:** When there's a significant issue with the inventory of a product at a specific facility.

**Important Note:**

The `rejectItemFromAllOrders` service is designed to reject items from all orders within a specific facility, not across all facilities as its name might suggest. The `facilityId` parameter is crucial in determining the scope of the rejection.
