The `ShipmentRouteSegment` entity in HotWax Commerce, which extends the standard Apache OFBiz definition, represents a specific leg or part of a shipment's journey. It captures details about the carrier, shipping method, origin, destination, and other relevant information for that particular segment of the shipment's route.

**Key Relationships:**

* **Shipment:** Each `ShipmentRouteSegment` belongs to a single `Shipment`.
* **Delivery:** A `ShipmentRouteSegment` can be optionally associated with a `Delivery` if it represents the final delivery leg.
* **Carrier Party:** The `carrierPartyId` links the segment to the `Party` responsible for its execution.
* **ShipmentMethodType:** The `shipmentMethodTypeId` specifies the type of shipping method used for this segment.
* **Origin and Destination Facilities & Contact Mechanisms:** The `originFacilityId`, `destFacilityId`, `originContactMechId`, etc., link the segment to its origin and destination points.
* **UOMs:** The `billingWeightUomId` and `currencyUomId` connect the segment to the relevant Units of Measure for billing weight and currency.

**HotWax Customizations:**

HotWax has extended the standard `ShipmentRouteSegment` entity with additional fields to accommodate specific business requirements related to COD (Cash On Delivery), third-party labels, tracking, and carrier details. These customizations enhance the system's ability to handle more complex shipment scenarios and integrate with various carrier services.
