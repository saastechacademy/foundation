### Workflows

#### Cycle Count Workflow
Cycle count session is assigned to a user. User scans items, app records scan events. Background process periodically pushes updates to server. User completes the count; final push succeeds.


#### Create InventoryCountImport
The planned cycle count task is assigned to Store Manager user. The store manager creates an `InventoryCountImport` record to start a new inventory count session. This record includes metadata such as the store location, assigned user, and start time.
The manager may create one or more `InventoryCountImport` records for the same `WorkEffort` if multiple users will be performing the count in parallel.
