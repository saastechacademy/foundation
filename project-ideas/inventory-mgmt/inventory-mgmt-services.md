**Validate Reset Inventory` input data provided for resetting inventory levels** 

**Purpose**

The primary purpose is to prevent errors and inconsistencies in inventory data by checking the following:

1.  **Product Identification:** Ensures that either a valid `productId` or `sku` (Stock Keeping Unit) is provided to identify the product whose inventory is being reset. Check if the product exists in the system and is not a virtual product (as virtual products don't have physical inventory).

2.  **Facility Identification:** Verify that a valid `facilityId` (or its external identifier, `externalFacilityId`) is provided to identify the facility where the inventory is located. Check if the facility exists in the system.

3.  **Location Identification:** If a `locationSeqId` is provided, it check if this location exists within the specified facility. This is important for tracking inventory at a granular level within a warehouse.

4.  **Quantity:** Checks if a valid `quantity` (or its deprecated alias, `availableQty`) is provided. This quantity represents the new inventory level to which the existing inventory will be reset.

**Error Handling**

If any of the validation checks fail, return an error message indicating the specific issue(s) found in the input data. This helps in identifying and correcting errors before proceeding with inventory updates.

**Input Parameters**

The service expects a map called `context` containing the following key-value pairs:

*   `locale`: The locale for error messages.
*   `payload`: A map containing the inventory data to be validated:
    *   `facilityId` (or `externalFacilityId`): The ID of the facility.
    *   `locationSeqId`: The ID of the location within the facility (optional).
    *   `productId` (or `sku`): The ID or SKU of the product.
    *   `quantity` (or `availableQty`): The new inventory quantity.

**Output**

The service returns a map with the following possible outcomes:

*   **Success:** If all validations pass, it returns a success message.
*   **Error:** If any validation fails, it returns an error message detailing the specific validation failures.

**Code Analysis**

Perform the following steps:

3.  **Product Validation:**
    *   Checks if either `productId` or `sku` is provided.
    *   If `productId` is provided, fetche the product from the database and checks if it's virtual.
    *   If `sku` is provided, find the corresponding `productId` and checks if the product is virtual.
    *   If the product is virtual, it adds an error message.
4.  **Facility Validation:**
    *   Check if either `facilityId` or `externalFacilityId` is provided.
    *   If `facilityId` is provided, it check if the facility exists.
    *   If `externalFacilityId` is provided, find the corresponding `facilityId` and checks if the facility exists.
    *   If neither facility ID is valid, it adds an error message.
5.  **Location Validation:**
    *   If `locationSeqId` is provided, it checks if the location exists within the specified facility.
    *   If the location is invalid, it adds an error message.
6.  **Quantity Validation:**
    *   Checks if either `quantity` or `availableQty` is provided.
    *   If neither is provided, it adds an error message.
7.  **Error Handling:**
    *   If any error messages were added, it returns an error result with the list of errors.
8.  **Success:** If all validations pass, it returns a success result.

**Example Usage in API**

In a REST API, you could use this service as follows:

1.  **Receive Request:** Get inventory data from the request body (JSON).
2.  **Call Service:** Pass the data to the `validateResetInventory` service.
3.  **Handle Response:**
    *   If successful, proceed with updating the inventory.
    *   If an error is returned, send an appropriate error response to the client with the validation failure details.

The `validateResetInventory` service is a crucial component in the inventory management system. It ensures that any request to modify inventory levels is accurate and valid before any changes are made. This helps maintain data integrity and prevent errors that could disrupt operations.

**Business Purpose**

The primary goal of this service is to validate the following aspects of an inventory reset request:

1.  **Product Identification:** The service confirms that the product whose inventory is being adjusted is correctly identified. This can be done using either the unique product ID or the product's SKU (Stock Keeping Unit). It also checks if the product is a physical item, as virtual products don't have inventory levels.

2.  **Facility Identification:** The service verifies that the facility where the inventory is located is accurately specified. This is done by checking the facility ID, which could be an internal identifier or an external code.

3.  **Location Identification (Optional):** If the inventory is stored in a specific location within the facility (like a shelf or bin), the service confirms the validity of this location ID. This is important for fine-grained inventory tracking.

4.  **Quantity:** The service ensures that a valid quantity is provided for the new inventory level. This quantity cannot be blank or invalid.

**Why Validation is Important**

Without proper validation, incorrect or incomplete data could lead to several problems:

*   **Incorrect Inventory Levels:** Adjusting the inventory of the wrong product or at the wrong location could lead to discrepancies between the system records and the actual physical inventory.
*   **Operational Disruptions:** If inventory levels are inaccurate, it can lead to stockouts, overstock situations, and delays in fulfilling orders.
*   **Financial Losses:** Inaccurate inventory data can result in incorrect financial reporting, impacting profitability and decision-making.

**How it Works**

The service takes the inventory reset request data as input. It then performs a series of checks to ensure the validity of the product, facility, location (if provided), and quantity. If any of these checks fail, the service returns a detailed error message explaining the issue. Only if all validations pass does the service allow the inventory update process to proceed.

**Benefits**

By using the `validateResetInventory` service, businesses can:

*   **Improve Data Accuracy:** Ensure that inventory data is consistently accurate and reliable.
*   **Prevent Errors:** Avoid costly mistakes caused by invalid inventory adjustments.
*   **Streamline Operations:** Facilitate smooth inventory management processes by catching errors early.
*   **Enhance Decision-Making:** Provide confidence in the inventory data used for decision-making.

Overall, this validation service plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity of inventory data, which is essential for efficient and profitable business operations.
