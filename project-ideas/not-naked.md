TODO:

Prepare list of scenarios 
    start with basics, the obvious ones, e.g Customer places BOPIS order,
    Order is received/imported in HC. 
        The Check if the facility assigned to the order is valid, The facility is configured to fulfill BOPIS order. Check if the orderItem has inventory reservation. Check if Order is listed in fulfillment application. 
        Thinking points: What configurations of HC enable BOPIS feature in OMS? FACT CHECKING
            Con you control 
                If config allows to choose Facility
                If config allows to choose Product for BOPIS from givin Facility
        You are testing the system configuration.
        
        How do we decide what to assert on?
        Starts with, What are we testing?
        In above example we are testing BOPIS configuration for a given client. We want to be sure that client system is configured to allow set of products for BOPIS order to be fulfilled from limited set of facilities/stores.
