**Understanding the [Shopify Order Resource](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/2024-07/resources/order#resource-object) JSON**

Think of the order JSON as a comprehensive snapshot of a customer's purchase on your Shopify store. It includes everything from basic details about the order itself to information about the customer, the products they bought, shipping details, payment information, and much more.



**Top-Level Structure**

The top level of the JSON contains essential order attributes:

* `id`:  The unique numerical identifier of the order in Shopify's system.
* `name`:  A human-readable order name (e.g., "#1001").
* `order_number`: A sequential order number (e.g., 1001).
* `created_at`, `updated_at`:  Timestamps indicating when the order was created and last modified.
* `financial_status`:  Reflects the payment status of the order (e.g., "paid", "pending", "authorized").
* `fulfillment_status`: Indicates whether the order has been shipped or is still pending (e.g., "fulfilled", "partial").
* `total_price`:  The total amount the customer paid, including taxes and shipping.
* `total_price_set`:  Set of the total amount the customer paid, including taxes and shipping.
* `currency`: The three-letter code (ISO 4217) for the currency used in the order.
* `presentment_currency`: The currency used for the order.
* `customer_locale`: The locale of the customer placing the order.
* `current_total_price_set`:  Set of the current total price.

**Nested Objects**

The order JSON includes several nested objects that provide more detailed information:

* **`customer`:** Holds information about the customer who placed the order, including their ID, name, email address, and marketing preferences.
* **`billing_address`, `shipping_address`:** Contain the billing and shipping address details, respectively. Each address has fields like `name`, `address1`, `city`, `province`, `zip`, and `country`.
* **`line_items`:** An array listing each product purchased in the order. Each line item includes details like `product_id`, `variant_id`, `quantity`, `price`, and tax information.
* **`shipping_lines`:**  An array of shipping methods chosen for the order, with their associated prices and other details.
* **`tax_lines`:** An array of tax line objects, each of which details the taxes applicable to the order.

**Customer Information**

* **customer:** An object containing the customer's details:
*  'id'
*  'email'
*  'first_name', 'last_name'
*  'accepts_marketing'
*  'addresses' (an array of addresses)

**Billing and Shipping Addresses**

*   `billing_address`:  The billing address of the customer.
*   `shipping_address`: The shipping address (if different from billing).

**Line Items**

*   `line_items`: An array of objects representing the products ordered:
    *   `id`
    *   `product_id`, `variant_id`
    *   `title`
    *   `quantity`, `fulfillable_quantity`
    *   `price`, `total_discount` 
    *   `sku`
    *   `grams` (weight)
    *   `tax_lines` (taxes applied)
    *   `properties` (custom attributes like engraving)

**Other Important Fields**

*   `discount_codes`: Codes applied to the order for discounts.
*   `shipping_lines`:  Details of shipping methods and costs.
*   `tax_lines`: Taxes applied to the order.
*   `fulfillments`: An array tracking the fulfillment process of items in the order.
*   `refunds`: An array of any refunds issued.
*   `note`: Notes added to the order by the merchant.
*   `note_attributes`: Key-value pairs for structured notes.
*   `tags`: Tags associated with the order.
*   `test`: A boolean indicating if the order is a test order.


**Preprocessing in the `createShopifyOrder` Service**

The preprocessing stage is the first step in the integration process. It focuses on preparing the incoming Shopify order data for conversion into a HotWax Commerce order. Here's a breakdown of the key steps:

1. **Configuration Retrieval and Filtering**

   * **Fetch Shopify Config:** The service retrieves the configuration for the specific Shopify store integration using the `shopifyConfigId` passed as an input parameter.
   * **Get Product Store ID:** From the `ShopifyConfig` entity, the service extracts the `productStoreId`, which is used in the next step.
   * **Load Properties:** The service reads the `ShopifyServiceConfig` properties file and looks up the property named `<productStoreId>.skip.order.import.tags`. This property value is expected to be a comma-separated list of tags.
   * **Tag-Based Filtering:** The service then compares the tags associated with the Shopify order to the tags in the `skip.order.import.tags` list. If a match is found, the order is marked as skipped and won't be imported.


The `ShopifyConfig` data is used in the `createShopifyOrder` service to retrieve configuration details necessary for processing the Shopify order. 


1. **Retrieve Shopify Configuration:**
   - The service queries the `ShopifyConfig` entity using the `shopifyConfigId` provided in the context to get the configuration details.
   - This configuration includes the `productStoreId` and `shopId`.

2. **Set Product Store:**
   - The `productStoreId` from the `ShopifyConfig` is used to set the product store for the order.

### Pseudocode

1. **Retrieve Shopify Configuration:**
   ```java
   GenericValue shopifyConfig = EntityQuery.use(delegator).from("ShopifyConfig").where("shopifyConfigId", shopifyConfigId).queryOne();
   ```

2. **Set Product Store:**
   ```java
   String productStoreId = shopifyConfig.getString("productStoreId");
   ```

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how `ShopifyConfig` data is utilized:

3. **Filter Orders Based on Tags:**
   - The service checks if the order should be skipped based on tags and configuration settings from `ShopifyConfig`.


4. **Determine Facility Details:**
   - The `productStoreId` is used to retrieve the default facility ID from the product store configuration.

5. **Order Processing Logic:**
   - The `shopId` from the `ShopifyConfig` is used to map the Shopify order source to a channel ID.

### Pseudocode

3. **Filter Orders Based on Tags:**
   ```java
   String skipOrdersTags = EntityUtilProperties.getPropertyValue("ShopifyServiceConfig", productStoreId + ".skip.order.import.tags", delegator);
   ```


### Business Requirements for Skip Order 

1. **Order Identification and Duplicate Check**

   * **Extract Shopify Order ID:** The service retrieves the Shopify order ID (e.g., "450789469") from the input JSON data using the `order.get("id")` method.
   * **Check for Duplicates:** It then queries the `OrderIdentification` entity in HotWax Commerce to see if an order with this Shopify ID has already been imported.
   * **Skip if Duplicate:** If a matching order is found, the current order is marked as a duplicate and will be skipped to prevent redundant data in the system.

2. **Filter Orders Based on Tags:**
   - Extract and clean tags from the order.
   - Check if the order should be skipped based on tags and configuration.

### Implementation Detail Design for Skip Order Tags

#### Pseudocode:

a. **Extract Tags from Order:**
   - Retrieve the tags from the `order` map.
   - Clean and process the tags.

b. **Retrieve Skip Tags Configuration:**
   - Fetch the skip tags configuration from the `ShopifyServiceConfig` properties file.

c. **Check Tags Against Configuration:**
   - Compare the tags from the order with the skip tags configuration.
   - If any tag matches the skip tags, set a flag to skip the order.

d. **Skip Order if Necessary:**
   - If the flag is set, skip the order creation process.

#### Code:

```java
// Extract and clean tags from the order
List<String> tags = UtilGenerics.checkList(order.get("tags"));
tags = tags.stream().map(String::trim).collect(Collectors.toList());

// Retrieve skip tags configuration from properties file
String skipTagsConfig = EntityUtilProperties.getPropertyValue("ShopifyServiceConfig", "skip.order.tags", delegator);
List<String> skipTags = Arrays.asList(skipTagsConfig.split(","));

// Check if the order should be skipped based on tags and configuration
boolean skipOrder = tags.stream().map(String::toLowerCase).anyMatch(skipTags::contains);


if (!skipOrder) {
    // Proceed with order creation
} else {
    // Skip the process
}
```

### Summary

- **Extract Tags from Order:** The tags are extracted from the `order` map and cleaned by trimming any whitespace.
- **Retrieve Skip Tags Configuration:** The skip tags configuration is fetched from the `ShopifyServiceConfig` properties file using the key `skip.order.tags`.
- **Check Tags Against Configuration:** The tags from the order are compared with the skip tags configuration. If any tag matches the skip tags, the `skipOrder` flag is set to `true`, and the order creation process is skipped.


**Key Points and Considerations**

* **Flexibility:** The `ShopifyServiceConfig` properties file allows for easy customization of which orders to import based on specific tags. This can be useful for filtering test orders, orders from specific sales channels, or any other order criteria you want to define.
* **Data Integrity:** The duplicate check is crucial for preventing duplicate orders in your HotWax Commerce system, ensuring data consistency and accuracy.


4. **Determine Facility Details:**
   ```java
   GenericValue productStore = ProductStoreWorker.getProductStore(productStoreId, delegator);
   String defaultFacilityId = productStore.getString("inventoryFacilityId");
   ```

5. **Order Source Processing Logic:**
   ```java
   String channelId = ShopifyHelper.getShopifyTypeMappedValue(delegator, shopId, "SHOPIFY_ORDER_SOURCE", (String) order.get("source_name"), "UNKNWN_SALES_CHANNEL");
   ```


### Explanation of Code to Get Customer Locale Details

1. **Retrieve Customer Locale:**
   - The code checks if the `order` map contains a non-empty value for the key `customer_locale`.
   - If it does, it retrieves the `customer_locale` value and stores it in the `customerLocale` variable.
   - It then creates a `Locale` object using the `Locale.forLanguageTag` method, which converts the `customerLocale` string to a `Locale` object.
   - The `Locale` object is then converted to a string representation and stored in the `baseLocale` variable.
   - Finally, the `baseLocale` is put into the `serviceCtx` map with the key `locale`.

### Code
```java
// Get customer locale details
if (UtilValidate.isNotEmpty(order.get("customer_locale"))) {
    String customerLocale = (String) order.get("customer_locale");
    String baseLocale = new Locale(Locale.forLanguageTag(customerLocale).getLanguage(), "").toString();
    serviceCtx.put("locale", baseLocale);
}
```

### How Locale is Used in Ofbiz Framework

1. **Locale Initialization:**
   - The `Locale` object is initialized from the `serviceCtx` map using the key `locale`.

2. **Locale-Specific Data Conversion:**
   - The `Locale` object is used to convert data types, such as converting the `total_price` from the order to a `BigDecimal`.

3. **Service Context:**
   - The `Locale` object is added to the `serviceCtx` map, which is then used in subsequent service calls to ensure locale-specific data handling.

### Code Example
```java
// Initialize Locale from service context
Locale locale = (Locale) context.get("locale");

// Use Locale for data conversion
BigDecimal grandTotal = (BigDecimal) ObjectType.simpleTypeConvert(order.get("total_price"), "BigDecimal", null, locale);

// Add Locale to service context for subsequent service calls
serviceCtx.put("locale", locale);

                        //get customer locale details
                        if (UtilValidate.isNotEmpty(order.get("customer_locale"))){
                            String customerLocale = (String) order.get("customer_locale");
                            String baseLocale = new Locale(Locale.forLanguageTag(customerLocale).getLanguage(), "").toString();

```


**Understanding `ShopifyHelper.getShopifyTypeMappedValue`**

This helper function seems designed to bridge the gap between Shopify's data model and HotWax Commerce's data model. It takes the following arguments:

1.  `delegator`: The OfBiz delegator for database operations.
2.  `shopId`: The ID of the Shopify shop.
3.  `mappedTypeId`: A string indicating the type of mapping being performed (e.g., "SHOPIFY_ORDER_SOURCE", "SHOP_ORD_CUST_CLASS", "SHOPIFY_PAYMENT_TYPE").
4.  `mappedKey`: The value from the Shopify order that needs to be mapped.
5.  `defaultValue`: A default value to return if no mapping is found.

The function  queries a database table (`ShopifyShopTypeMapping`) to find a corresponding `mappedValue` in HotWax Commerce for the given `mappedKey` and `mappedTypeId`. If no mapping exists, it returns the `defaultValue`.

**Scenarios in `createShopifyOrder`**

1.  **Sales Channel Mapping:**
    *   `mappedTypeId`: "SHOPIFY_ORDER_SOURCE"
    *   `mappedKey`: The value of the `source_name` field in the Shopify order (e.g., "web", "pos", "mobile_app").
    *   Purpose: Determine the sales channel in HotWax Commerce based on where the order originated in Shopify.

2.  **Customer Classification Mapping:**
    *   `mappedTypeId`: "SHOP_ORD_CUST_CLASS"
    *   `mappedKey`: Tags from the Shopify order.
    *   Purpose: Assign a customer classification in HotWax Commerce based on tags applied to the order in Shopify. This could be used for segmentation or reporting.

3.  **Payment Method Mapping:**
    *   `mappedTypeId`: "SHOPIFY_PAYMENT_TYPE"
    *   `mappedKey`: The payment gateway name from the Shopify order (e.g., "shopify_payments", "paypal").
    *   Purpose: Determine the payment method type in HotWax Commerce based on the payment gateway used in Shopify.


**Understanding use of SHOPIFY_PRODUCT_TAG**

**Purpose**
In this context, Shopify tags should be considered as indicators of pre-order or backorder products in HotWax Commerce.

**Parameters**

*   `mappedTypeId`: "SHOPIFY_PRODUCT_TAG"
    *   This tells the function to look for mappings related to product tags in the `ShopifyShopTypeMapping` table.
*   `mappedKey`: "ON_PRE_ORDER_PROD" or "ON_BACK_ORDER_PROD"
    *   These are the specific Shopify product tags you're interested in. 

**Logic**

1.  **Mapping Lookup:** The `getShopifyTypeMappedValue` function queries the `ShopifyShopTypeMapping` table. It searches for rows where:
    *   `mappedTypeId` is "SHOPIFY_PRODUCT_TAG"
    *   `mappedKey` is either "ON_PRE_ORDER_PROD" or "ON_BACK_ORDER_PROD"

2.  **Tag Retrieval:**  If matching rows are found, the function returns the corresponding `mappedValue` for each tag. These `mappedValue` strings are the tags that HotWax Commerce recognizes as indicating pre-order or backorder status.

3.  **Order Item Status:** The retrieved tags are then used to determine the availability status of the order items in HotWax Commerce.

    *   If a line item's product in Shopify has a tag that matches the mapped pre-order tag, the corresponding order item in HotWax Commerce is marked as a pre-order.
    *   Similarly, if a line item's product has a tag matching the mapped backorder tag, the HotWax Commerce order item is marked as a backorder.

**Example**

Let's say your `ShopifyShopTypeMapping` table has these entries:

| shopId   | mappedTypeId        | mappedKey            | mappedValue             |
| -------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| "your-shop-id" | "SHOPIFY_PRODUCT_TAG" | "ON_PRE_ORDER_PROD" | "PreOrder"             |
| "your-shop-id" | "SHOPIFY_PRODUCT_TAG" | "ON_BACK_ORDER_PROD"  | "BackOrder"   |

In this scenario:

*   If a Shopify product has the tag "ON_PRE_ORDER_PROD", the corresponding HotWax Commerce order item will be marked as a pre-order.
*   If a Shopify product has the tag "ON_BACK_ORDER_PROD", the HotWax Commerce order item will be marked as a backorder.

In the `createShopifyOrder` service, the `ShopifyHelper` class is utilized in the following additional scenarios:

1.  **Product and Variant Mapping:**
    *   The `ShopifyHelper.getProductId` function is used to retrieve the HotWax Commerce product ID corresponding to a Shopify variant ID. This is essential for associating order line items with the correct products in the HotWax system.
    *   If the product ID is not found and product creation is allowed, the service creates a new product in HotWax Commerce and associates it with the Shopify variant ID using `createShopifyShopProduct`.

2.  **Facility Mapping:**
    *   The `ShopifyHelper.getFacilityId` function is used to determine the HotWax Commerce facility ID based on the Shopify location ID where the order was fulfilled. This helps in managing inventory and fulfillment processes.

3.  **Pre-Order and Backorder Tag Mapping:**
    *   The `ShopifyHelper.getShopifyTypeMappedValue` function is used with `mappedTypeId` "SHOPIFY_PRODUCT_TAG" to retrieve the tags used in Shopify to indicate pre-order or backorder products. These tags are then used to determine if an order item should be marked as a pre-order or backorder in HotWax Commerce.


### **FacilityId computation Logic**

1.  **Prioritize Shopify Location (If Applicable):** The code first attempts to determine the `facilityId` based on the `location_id` present in the Shopify order, but only if the order is not tagged as "SENDSALE". This is done using the `ShopifyHelper.getFacilityId` function, which looks up a mapping between Shopify locations and HotWax Commerce facilities.

2.  **Check Inventory Reservation Setting:** If the Shopify order doesn't have a `location_id`, or it's tagged as "SENDSALE", or no mapping is found, the code then checks the `reserveInventory` flag of the associated product store.

3.  **Use Default Facility:** If the product store has inventory reservation enabled (`reserveInventory` is "Y") *and* a default inventory facility (`inventoryFacilityId`) is specified, then that facility is used as the `facilityId`.

4.  **Fallback to "_NA_" Facility:** If none of the above conditions are met (i.e., no location ID, no location-to-facility mapping, no inventory reservation, or no default facility), the code defaults the `facilityId` to "_NA_". This ensures that the `facilityId` variable always has a value, even if it's a placeholder representing an unallocated order in the HotWax Commerce OMS.


### Override the default order line item fulfillment facility

The enums `PRE_SLCTD_FAC_TAG`, `ORD_ITM_PICKUP_FAC`, and `ORD_ITM_SHIP_FAC` are used to define settings in the `ProductStoreSetting` entity. These settings play a crucial role in customizing the order fulfillment process within the HotWax Commerce OMS.

Overriding the default fulfillment facility for an order item based on specific properties set within the Shopify line item. If the Shopify order and its line items meet certain conditions (tags and property names), the system will look for a designated property in the line item's properties and use its value to determine the fulfillment facility, potentially enabling more flexible and customized fulfillment workflows.


Overriding the default fulfillment facility based on item-specific properties is as follows:

```java
List<String> lineItemNameSettings = EntityQuery.use(delegator).from("ProductStoreSetting")
        .where(EntityCondition.makeCondition("productStoreId", productStoreId), 
               EntityCondition.makeCondition("settingTypeEnumId", EntityOperator.IN, UtilMisc.toList("ORD_ITM_PICKUP_FAC", "ORD_ITM_SHIP_FAC")))
        .getFieldList("settingValue");

if (UtilValidate.isNotEmpty(properties) && UtilValidate.isNotEmpty(tagsList) && 
    UtilValidate.isNotEmpty(lineItemNameSettings) && UtilValidate.isNotEmpty(preSelectedFacTag) && 
    tagsList.stream().anyMatch(preSelectedFacTag::equalsIgnoreCase)) {

    Optional<Map<String, String>> facilityOpt = properties.stream()
            .filter(property -> lineItemNameSettings.contains(property.get("name")))
            .findFirst();

    if (facilityOpt.isPresent()) {
        fromFacilityId = facilityOpt.get().get("value");
    }
}
```

1. **Retrieve Facility-Related Settings:**
   * The code starts by fetching the values of two product store settings: "ORD_ITM_PICKUP_FAC" and "ORD_ITM_SHIP_FAC". These settings define the property names used within Shopify line items to specify the desired pickup or shipping facility.
   * The `lineItemNameSettings` list now contains these property names.

2. **Check for Pre-Selected Facility Tag:**
   * The code then checks if certain conditions are met:
     * The `properties` list (extracted from the Shopify line item) is not empty.
     * The `tagsList` (extracted from the Shopify order) is not empty.
     * The `lineItemNameSettings` list is not empty.
     * The `preSelectedFacTag` (another product store setting, likely indicating a tag that triggers this facility override logic) is not empty.
     * At least one tag in the `tagsList` matches the `preSelectedFacTag`.

3. **Extract Facility ID from Properties:**
   * If all the conditions in step 2 are true, it means the order is eligible for facility override based on item properties.
   * The code then filters the `properties` list to find a property whose name matches one of the facility-related setting values (either "ORD_ITM_PICKUP_FAC" or "ORD_ITM_SHIP_FAC").
   * If such a property is found, its value is extracted and assigned to the `fromFacilityId` variable. This value likely represents the ID or identifier of the desired fulfillment facility.


### **Explanation of Enums and their Usage**

1.  **`PRE_SLCTD_FAC_TAG`**
    *   **Purpose:** This enum defines a setting in the `ProductStoreSetting` entity to store the name of a specific tag used in Shopify orders. When an order from Shopify contains this tag, it triggers the `createShopifyOrder` service to check for pre-selected facilities for fulfilling the line items within that order.

2.  **`ORD_ITM_PICKUP_FAC`**
    *   **Purpose:** This enum defines another setting in the `ProductStoreSetting` entity to store the property name used within Shopify line items to indicate the pre-selected facility for store pickup orders.

3.  **`ORD_ITM_SHIP_FAC`**
    *   **Purpose:** Similar to `ORD_ITM_PICKUP_FAC`, this enum defines a setting to store the property name used in Shopify line items to indicate the pre-selected facility for same-day shipping orders.


### **Item Adjustments**  

The `itemAdjustments` data in HotWax Commerce is primarily derived from two sections of the Shopify Order JSON:

1.  **discount\_allocations:** This section within each line item details the discounts applied to that specific product. The code iterates through these allocations, extracts the discount amount and any associated discount code, and creates `EXT_PROMO_ADJUSTMENT` entries in `itemAdjustments`.

2.  **tax\_lines:** This section within each line item provides information about the taxes applied to the product. The code extracts the tax title, price, and rate, and creates `SALES_TAX` entries in `itemAdjustments`.

**Mapping**

| Shopify Order Field (within line\_items) | HotWax Commerce Field (in itemAdjustments) |
| :--------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| discount\_allocations.amount             | amount (negated)                           |
| discount\_allocations.discount\_application\_index | Used to look up the discount code in `discounts` map |
| tax\_lines.title                         | comments                                   |
| tax\_lines.price                         | amount                                     |
| tax\_lines.rate                          | sourcePercentage                           |



### **Customer Handling**


```java
result = dispatcher.runSync("customerDataSetup", serviceCtx);
```

This line calls the `customerDataSetup` service to either create a new customer in HotWax Commerce (if the customer doesn't exist) or retrieve the existing customer's ID. The `customerId` is then included in the `serviceCtx` map passed to `createSalesOrder`.


```java
storeOrderCtx.put("partyId", customerId);
storeOrderCtx.put("billToCustomerPartyId", customerId);
storeOrderCtx.put("shipToCustomerPartyId", customerId);
```

### Customer Classification 

HotWax Commerce employs a systematic process to deduce the `customerClassificationId` from a Shopify order. It leverages the `ShopifyShopTypeMapping` entity, which acts as a bridge between Shopify customer tags and their corresponding classifications within the HotWax Commerce system.

**Process Breakdown**

1.  **Retrieve Customer Class Mappings:**
    *   The service begins by fetching a list of `customerClassMappings` from the `ShopifyShopTypeMapping` entity. These mappings are specifically filtered to include only those with the `mappedTypeId` of "SHOP_ORD_CUST_CLASS," indicating their relevance to customer classification.
    *   The `shopId` associated with the Shopify order is also used to ensure that the retrieved mappings are specific to the relevant Shopify shop.

2.  **Check for Tags and Mappings:**
    *   The service then verifies if both the `customerClassMappings` list and the `tags` associated with the Shopify order are not empty. This check is essential to proceed with the mapping process only if relevant data is available.

3.  **Match Tags with Mappings:**
    *   If both tags and mappings exist, the service iterates through the `customerClassMappings` and attempts to find a mapping whose `mappedKey` (representing a Shopify tag) matches any of the tags present in the order.
    *   The matching is performed in a case-insensitive manner using `equalsIgnoreCase`.

4.  **Extract and Set `customerClassificationId`**:
    *   If a matching mapping is found, it signifies that the Shopify order contains a tag that corresponds to a predefined customer classification in HotWax Commerce.
    *   The `mappedValue` from the matching `customerClassEnum` (which represents the HotWax Commerce `customerClassificationId`) is then extracted and placed into the `serviceCtx` map.
    *   This `serviceCtx` is subsequently used when creating the sales order in HotWax Commerce, ensuring that the customer associated with the order is assigned the appropriate classification.

**In Conclusion**

The process of deducing the `customerClassificationId` in the `createShopifyOrder` service involves retrieving relevant mappings from the `ShopifyShopTypeMapping` entity, comparing the Shopify order tags with these mappings, and extracting the corresponding HotWax Commerce classification ID if a match is found. This enables the system to categorize customers based on their Shopify tags, facilitating targeted marketing, personalized experiences, and streamlined order management within the HotWax Commerce OMS.


### **"POS sales channel"**

Handle POS orders, assign them a specific shipping method "POS_COMPLETED".

```java
boolean isCashSaleOrder = (UtilValidate.isEmpty(order.get("shipping_lines")) && "POS_SALES_CHANNEL".equals(channelId) && "fulfilled".equals(order.get("fulfillment_status")));
```

This condition checks if:

1.  The order has no shipping lines (`order.get("shipping_lines")` is empty).
2.  The `channelId` (derived from the `source_name`) is "POS\_SALES\_CHANNEL."
3.  The `fulfillment_status` is "fulfilled."

If all these conditions are true, the variable `isCashSaleOrder` is set to `true`, indicating a potential POS order.

The code then uses this `isCashSaleOrder` flag to set the `shipmentMethodTypeId` to "POS\_COMPLETED":

```java
if (isCashSaleOrder) {
    shipmentMethodTypeId = "POS_COMPLETED";
}
```

### Order Attributes:

*   **`note_attributes`:** Any custom note attributes present in the Shopify order JSON are mapped as individual `OrderAttribute` entities in HotWax Commerce. The `name` and `value` fields from each `note_attributes` entry are directly used as the `attrName` and `attrValue` in the `OrderAttribute` entity.

*   **`note_attributes`:**
    *   Example from sample JSON:
        ```json
        "note_attributes": [
            {
              "name": "custom name",
              "value": "custom value"
            }
          ]
        ```
        This would be stored as an `OrderAttribute` with `attrName` = "custom name" and `attrValue` = "custom value."

*   **`user_id`:**
    *   The ID of the staff member who created the order in Shopify is stored as an `OrderAttribute` with the name `shopify_user_id`.



### The Shopify Order Item attributes:

*   **`properties`:** Custom properties associated with line items in the Shopify order are mapped as `OrderItemAttribute` entities in HotWax Commerce. The `name` and `value` fields from each `properties` entry are used as the `attrName` and `attrValue` in the `OrderItemAttribute` entity.
*   **Pre-order and Backorder Tags:** If a product in the Shopify order is tagged as "ON\_PRE\_ORDER\_PROD" or "ON\_BACK\_ORDER\_PROD," this information is stored in an `OrderItemAttribute` with the name "PreOrderItemProperty" or "BackOrderItemProperty" respectively.
*   **Store Pickup Property:** If a line item in the Shopify order has a property indicating store pickup, this information is stored in an `OrderItemAttribute` with the name "StorePickupItemProperty."
*   **Group order items based on custom attributes or properties.**
*   **Override the default order line item fulfillment facility**


### Order Item Attributes:

*   **`properties`:**
    *   Custom properties associated with line items in the Shopify order are mapped as `OrderItemAttribute` entities in HotWax Commerce.
    *   The `name` and `value` fields from each `properties` entry are used as the `attrName` and `attrValue` in the `OrderItemAttribute` entity.
    *   Example from sample JSON:
        ```json
        "properties": [
            {
              "name": "custom engraving",
              "value": "Happy Birthday Mom!"
            }
          ]
        ```
        This would be stored as an `OrderItemAttribute` with `attrName` = "custom engraving" and `attrValue` = "Happy Birthday Mom!"
