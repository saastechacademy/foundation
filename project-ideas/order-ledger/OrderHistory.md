### Use Scenarios

1. **Event: Item Rejection from Fulfillment**
    - A record in `OrderHistory` is made because it's an event in the order's lifecycle; the order was rejected after brokering.
    - A record in `OrderFacilityChange` is made because the facility of the order is changed after rejection.

2. **Event: Order Brokering**
    - Entries are made in both tables because the order is brokered:
        - This is an event in the order's lifecycle when the order item is brokered.
        - The facility of the order is also changed.
