### From Business Requirements to Solution Design

#### Overview:
This activity is designed to enhance the skills of business analysts in understanding, documenting, and designing solutions for complex business requirements. Through a hands-on approach, analysts will delve into the nuances of omnichannel strategies by analyzing real-world examples from the HotWax.co website.

#### Learning Objectives:
- **Write Business Requirements:** Develop the ability to clearly and concisely document business requirements as the first step towards creating effective solutions.
- **Analyze Business Requirements and Prepare Solution Design:** Cultivate the skill to analyze documented requirements, identify challenges, and design comprehensive solutions using Unified Modeling Language (UML) constructs.

#### Preparation:
Analysts are required to explore and study blogs published on the HotWax.co website, focusing on the following categories:
1. Buy Online, Pick-up In Store (BOPIS)
2. Store Inventory Management
3. Ship from Store
4. Pre-Order Management
5. BI Reports & Analytics

#### Task Instructions:
1. **Document Business Requirements and Challenges:**
   - For each blog post in the specified categories, prepare a detailed write-up that identifies the business requirements and challenges associated with the omnichannel strategy discussed.
   - Highlight key points that businesses need to consider when implementing these strategies.

2. **Prepare Solution Design:**
   - Analyze the documented requirements to propose a solution design.
   - Utilize various UML constructs (e.g., Use Case Diagrams, Activity Diagrams, Sequence Diagrams, etc.) to illustrate the solution architecture and process flow.

3. **Group Discussion Preparation:**
   - Prepare to present your solution design during a group discussion session.
   - Be ready to discuss the following topics:
     - The role of various database entities throughout the business process.
     - How the data model facilitates the delivery of business requirements.
     - Identification of all entities involved and their data state changes.
     - Use of sample data to explain the process flow.
     - Writing and explaining SQL queries relevant to the business problem at hand.

#### Group Discussion Session:
During the group discussion, each analyst will:
- **Present Their Solution:** Share your solution design with peers, highlighting key aspects and how it addresses the documented requirements.
- **Engage in Peer Review:** Participate in constructive discussions, offering feedback on others' designs and incorporating suggestions into your own work.
- **Deep Dive into Technical Details:** Discuss the technical intricacies of your solution, including database design, data flow, and query optimization.
- **Collaborate and Learn:** Use this opportunity to learn from your peers, explore different perspectives, and refine your approach to business analysis and solution design.

#### Expected Outcome:
By the end of this activity, analysts will have gained hands-on experience in transforming business requirements into actionable solution designs.
