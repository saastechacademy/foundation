# **Facility Management API**

## Data Model

The core entities used for modeling facility and location information in our inventory management application are:

### Facility
Represents a physical location where inventory is stored.
- **facilityId** (Primary Key): Unique identifier for the facility.
- **facilityTypeId:** Type of facility (e.g., "RETAIL_STORE", "WAREHOUSE").
- **facilityName:** Name of the facility.

### FacilityLocation
Represents a specific location within a facility where inventory can be stored (e.g., aisles, shelves, bins).
- **locationSeqId** (Primary Key): Unique identifier for the location within the facility.
- **locationTypeEnumId:** Type of location (e.g., "FLT_PICKLOC" for picking locations, "FLT_BULK" for bulk storage locations).
- **areaId**, **aisleId**, **sectionId**: Additional identifiers for organizing locations within the facility.

## Data model Product, association with Facility and storage location in the Facility

### Product
This entity stores the main details of a product, such as its ID, type, name, description, and various attributes like weight, dimensions, and images.

### ProductFacility
This entity establishes the relationship between a product and a facility, indicating that the product is stocked or available at that facility. It also includes additional information like minimum stock levels, reorder quantities, and estimated shipping days.

### ProductFacilityLocation
This entity further refines the product-facility relationship by specifying the exact location(s) within a facility where a particular product is stored. It includes details like minimum stock levels and move quantities for each location.

```json
{
    "productId": "10000",
    "minimumStock": 20.0,
    "reorderQuantity": 10.0,
    "daysToShip": 5,
    "facilityId":"100165",
    "productFacilityLocations": [
      {
        "productId": "10000",
        "facilityId":"100165",
        "locationSeqId": "L001",
        "minimumStock": 10.0,
        "moveQuantity": 20.0
      },
      {
