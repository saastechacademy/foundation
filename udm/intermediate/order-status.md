The status management system is a fundamental component that governs the lifecycle of various entities such as orders, invoices, and payments. This system is comprised of several entities that interact to define, track, and control the statuses of these business objects. 

### StatusItem
StatusItem represents individual statuses that can be assigned to business objects within OFBiz. Each StatusItem is identified by a unique statusId and contains descriptive information about the status, such as its name and description. These items define the possible states that an object, like a sales order, can be in at any point in time.

### StatusType
StatusType categorizes StatusItems into broader groups. For example, sales order statuses, invoice statuses, and payment statuses might each have their own StatusType. This allows for the organization and management of different kinds of statuses within the system, making it easier to handle status changes across various types of business objects.

### StatusValidChange
StatusValidChange defines the permissible transitions between statuses for a given type of business object. It essentially outlines the workflow or lifecycle that an object can undergo by specifying which status changes are valid. Each record in StatusValidChange might include the current status (statusId), the next allowable status (statusIdTo), and the type of status (statusTypeId) to ensure that transitions are appropriate and logical given the context of the object's current state.

### OrderStatus
OrderStatus tracks the history of status changes for each order. It records every time an order's status changes, including the time of the change and the reason for it. This entity provides a historical record of the order's progression through its lifecycle, from creation to completion or cancellation.

### Sales Order Lifecycle Example
To illustrate how these entities interact within the lifecycle of a sales order, consider the following stages:

* Order Creation: When a sales order is first created, it is assigned an initial status, typically something like ORDER_CREATED. This initial status is a StatusItem, which falls under a StatusType relevant to sales orders.

* Order Processing: Once the order is being processed, its status might change to ORDER_PROCESSING. The transition from ORDER_CREATED to ORDER_PROCESSING must be defined in StatusValidChange as a valid change for the sales order StatusType, ensuring that this progression is allowed.

* Order Approval: After processing, the order may be reviewed and then approved, changing the status to ORDER_APPROVED. Again, the StatusValidChange entity must list this as a permissible transition from ORDER_PROCESSING.

* Order Completion: Once the order has been fulfilled (e.g., shipped to the customer), its status changes to ORDER_COMPLETED. The transition from ORDER_APPROVED to ORDER_COMPLETED is validated through StatusValidChange.

* Order Cancellation/Return: If the order is canceled or returned, it transitions to ORDER_CANCELLED or ORDER_RETURNED, respectively. These transitions are also governed by StatusValidChange, ensuring that they only occur from valid preceding statuses.

Throughout this lifecycle, each change in status is recorded in the OrderStatus entity, providing a timestamped log of the order's progression through its defined lifecycle.
