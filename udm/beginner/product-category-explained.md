### Tax Category
Purpose: Tax Category is responsible for applying and calculating tax for all the products belonging to Tax Category. Tax Category need not be associated with Browse Root Category.
Description: Tax Category can be treated as grouping of products on which you want to apply same tax percent rate. The advantage of this type of categorization for applying tax is that it prevents application of multiple taxes/tax percent rate on single items. Various Tax Categories can be created for a number of product groups if the tax percent applied is different for various product groups. For instance, if you have to setup tax percent for food products as 3.0% and 5.0% for water products for all orders of Utah state, you have to setup two categories for it- "FOOD_TAX_CATEGORY" and "WATER_TAX_CATEGORY". After adding the products to the categories, the categories need to be associated with the tax authority and two different tax rates (3.0% and 5.0%) will be set for them. Now when a user will purchase a product from the storefront, the tax will be calculated based on the tax rate of the category to which the product belongs.
Category Type: TAX_CATEGORY

Additional Notes

The visibility of a product will depend on the introduction date of product i.e; an algorithm could be applied to display the last 20 products added to the storefront based on their introduction date.
Algorithms are applied to the Whats New Category which determine what product will be displayed in the category. The products to be displayed in the category are sorted on the basis of introduction date.
In Ofbiz instead of applying some algorithm to determine what all products will be displayed in the category, the merchandising manager is given the authority to decide and manage the products present over there.
Sequence number in Product Category Rollup and Product Category Member depicts the order in which the categories and products will be displayed on the front store respectively.
Best Practice: Set the Product Category Members if page will show the products
Best Practice: Set Category Rollups if the page will show the categories.
