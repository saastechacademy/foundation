**Problem Statement:**

The goal of this task is to examine the existing design of our Universal Data Model in Apache OFBiz, with a specific focus on identifying common design patterns. Understanding these patterns will help us develop adaptable data models suited for various business functionalities like orders or products.

**Assignment:**

1. **Review the Data Model:** Start by studying the current Universal Data Model used at HotWax Systems. Pay close attention to how the data is structured and organized.

2. **Focus on Type Entities:** Specifically analyze the “type” entities within the data model. These entities often categorize other data and play a crucial role in the model's flexibility and scalability.

3. **Identify Patterns:** Identify recurring patterns or themes in the data model design. Look for patterns that help in managing and organizing data effectively.

**Objective:**

Extract and document general observations about these patterns, focusing on how they could potentially be applied or modified for developing new data models for different areas like order management or product tracking.

**Deliverables:**

- **Summary of Findings:** A document highlighting the key patterns identified, with explanations on the role and importance of “type” entities. Include examples where possible.

- **Suggestions for Application:** Outline how the observed patterns could be used or adapted for other data modeling purposes within our projects.
