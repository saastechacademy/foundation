### What is a Product?
A product is an individual piece of merchandise or service that can be offered in the market to satisfies customer's needs. A product can be manufactured from the raw material or simply processed to be sold as finished good which is branded, packages and labeled by the company. A products are distinguished based on the unique Id/SKUs and are available with various features such as color, style, size, brands etc.

#### Product Variant Association
**Virtual & Variant Product** 
In eCommerce a virtual product is modeled to group products with similar features into a product having undefined feature (Size & Color etc). These products allow user to provide specific information about the product to select a real product (X Color, Y size).

A virtual product is a product which has several selectable features, each of which resolves to an actual physical product. Each of the selectable feature combination will result into a variant with standard features.

For eg: A T-shirt is a virtual product which is available in different sizes (small, medium large and extra large) and colors (red, grey, blue, green and black). So Color and Size are the selectable features of Virtual product T-shirt which does not exist physically in the inventory. Now if I select Small size and Red color then actually there will be a variant T-shirt in with these two features as standard features.

**Product Association**
A Product Variant association is used to associate Virtual Product with its Variants. You can associate as many variant with a virtual product as feature combinations possible but only single unit of a variant will be associated with a virtual product.

For this association virtual product must be setup as a finished good and have isVirtual set to 'Y' indicating that no inventory is kept for this product. Similarly the variant product must also be set as a finished good and have isVirtual set to 'Y'. The virtual product product will have some selectable features associated with them that will be indeed associated as standard features with one or more variants.

Purpose: The main purpose of this association is to group the similar products with similar features set to be sold as a single product on the online store. This association is also used by a merchandiser to organize products in the catalog sharing similar attributes at but sold at one place as a separate merchandise unit.

### Product Component Association
Package, Bundle, Kit and Components
Product packages, bundles and kits are collection or grouping of products which allows merchandiser to sell multiple products as a single unit. This facilitates the customer to buy a multiple related products on one click. Components are the products which are collected together to be sold as bundle or kit or a package.

Bundles are collection of similar items allowing merchandiser to offer several units of a products for sale as one combined product. These are usually sold at low marginal cost therefore incites customer to purchase products in bulk. The components in the bundle can also be sold separately depending on the merchandising policies.

Kits or Packages are collection of related items that are intended for same purpose or use. A merchandiser groups multiple related products to be sold in a kit or package that sometimes may not be sold independently. Kits or packages can be pre-built or customizable depending on the merchandising requirement.

For example: A burger may be $10, but it's combo package offering fries and a drink for $5 more. If purchased separately, the fries and drink would cost $5 each.

**Product Association**
Product Component association is used to associate a component with its package/bundle. You can associate as many components as possible with a package/bundle and any number of component units can be added to them.

For this association the package/bundle should already be setup as Marketing Package. The component products will be setup as normal finished goods. When a package or bundle is purchased then the price applicable to that package or bundle is offered to the customer and the component level price is ignored. For individual component sale the component level pricing will be applicable.

Purpose: The main purpose of this association is to allow merchandiser to sell related products collectively as a single unit at low marginal price. Merchandiser uses this association for promotional purpose and to increase sales of some related products that can be ignored if sold individually. With this merchandiser can allow customers to purchase multiple related products on single click and at low marginal prices.
