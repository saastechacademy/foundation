## Updating data:

- Solr does not duplicate data while uploading multiple times
- Because the example solr schema specifies a unique key field called id in a file named either managed-schema or schema.xml
- Whenever you POST commands to solr to add a document with the same value for the unique key as an existing document, it automatically replaces it for you

  
## Deleting data:

```bash
bin/post -c <Collection Name> -d "<delete><id>SP2514N</id></delete>"
```
This will delete the document with id=SP2514N

**To delete all documents**
```bash
  bin/post -c <Collection Name> -d "<delete><query>*:*</query></delete>"
```

## Delete a collection
To delete a collection<sup>[3]</sup> use this command
```bash
bin/solr delete -c <Collection Name>
```
