# Solr Cloud

SolrCloud is a distributed search platform built on top of Apache Solr, designed to provide scalability, fault tolerance, and centralized configuration management. It enables you to deploy Solr across a cluster<sup>[1]</sup> of machines, distributing indexes and queries for high availability and performance. 

Key components include Cluster<sup>[1]</sup>, Solr Node<sup>[2]</sup>, Collection<sup>[3]</sup>, Shard<sup>[4]</sup>, Replica<sup>[5]</sup>, Cores<sup>[6]</sup> and ZooKeeper<sup>[7]</sup>

**Points to clarify some common confusions:**
- One core and its replicas typically belong to a single Solr node, but different cores from different nodes can be part of the same collection.
- A replica in Solr is essentially a duplicate instance of a core, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance within a Solr cluster.
- Collections can consist of multiple cores, each distributed across different nodes within the Solr cluster.
- Shards, which are partitions of data within a collection, are distributed across multiple nodes in the Solr cluster to distribute the index and query load.
- Shards in Solr utilize the data indexed by cores. Each shard contains a subset of the indexed data, managed by the cores assigned to it. When queries are executed, each shard processes its portion of the query against the indexed data within its cores, contributing to the overall query results.
- Shards are utilized during query execution to distribute workload across cores, while cores handle indexing data.
- Multiple Solr nodes can work on the same collection within a Solr cluster.
- Solr dynamically manages the distribution of shards and replicas across nodes to optimize performance and resource utilization, including automatic rebalancing when new nodes are added or existing nodes are removed.
- Understanding the distributed nature of Solr and how it manages data across multiple nodes is essential for optimizing performance and ensuring reliability in large-scale deployments.

### Launching Solr in SolrCloud Mode

To start Solr in SolrCloud mode, use the following command:
```bash
bin/solr start -e cloud
```
This will start an interactive session that will start 2 solr servers on machine

- `./bin/solr` refers to solr script located in the directory
- `start` means start solr instance
- `-e cloud` starts solr instance in cloud mode
  - In solr cloud mode, a solr cluster<sup>[1]</sup> consist of multiple solr nodes<sup>[2]</sup> working together to handle search queries and index updates

Follow up process:

- This will ask *how many Solr nodes would you like to run in your local cluster?*. Press enter to run 2 nodes which is default (Default option is shown in []).
- Now you have to enter ports for both nodes. Press enter to use default port.
- Then you have to enter name of your collection<sup>[3]</sup>. Enter a name for your collection and press enter
- Then it will ask how many shards<sup>[4]</sup> you want to create. Go with default [2] and press enter
- Then it will ask how many replicas<sup>[5]</sup> you want to create. Again go with default.
- Then you have to choose configuration:
  
    **Choosing a Configset for Your Solr Collection**
    When setting up a Solr collection<sup>[3]</sup>, you'll need to decide on the appropriate configset to use. Solr provides two main options:

    **Default Configset**: The `_default` configset is a minimalist starting point, offering essential configuration files to begin your Solr collection<sup>[3]</sup>. It's suitable for users who prefer to       build their configurations from scratch or have specific customization needs beyond the provided templates.

    **Specialized Configsets**: Solr also offers specialized configsets tailored to specific scenarios or sample datasets. For example, the `sample_techproducts_configs` configset is optimized for use with the "techproducts" dataset, providing preconfigured settings and schema definitions aligned with this dataset's requirements.
  
     We will see default later, for now just type sample_techproducts_configs to choose this config and press enter

This will start your Solr in SolrCloud Mode. Go to - http://localhost:8983/solr to open admin page.

## Stopping Solr instance

This command stops all running Solr nodes<sup>[2]</sup> on the local machine:
```bash
bin/solr stop -all
```

Alternatively, you can specify a specific node to stop by providing its port number:
```bash
bin/solr stop -p <port_number>
```
Replace <port_number> with the port number of the Solr instance you want to stop.

## Restart Solr
if you've stopped you need to restart it, follow these steps:

1. Start the first node using the following command:
    ```bash
    ./bin/solr start -c -p 8983 -s example/cloud/node1/solr
    ```
    This command initiates the first node.

2. Once the first node is up and running, proceed to start the second node and specify its connection to ZooKeeper<sup>[7]</sup>:
    ```bash
    ./bin/solr start -c -p 7574 -s example/cloud/node2/solr -z localhost:9983
