# Solr Basic Searching

Solr can be queried through various methods including REST clients, curl, Chrome POSTMAN, etc., or through native clients available for many programming languages. The Solr Admin UI provides a query builder interface via the Query tab for collections. Go to admin UI and in the sidebar you will see a Collection Selector. Click on your collection here. This will list down the options. Click on the Query option. It will show the panel where you can query the data that you have indexed.

You can also go directly via this link- http://localhost:8983/solr/#/mycollection/query (replace mycollection with the name of collection that you have created)

Click on the `Execute query` without selecting any option. This will list down all of the data that you have indexed. But in the response you will see only 10 results because by default maximum 10 rows are returned via this query. To return `n` number of rows add this parameter to the end of the url `&rows=n` to retrieve maximum `n` number of rows

## Performing Searches
### Query Parameters
- **q**: Represents the query parameter used to specify search terms.
- **rows**: Determines the number of rows (documents) to be returned in the search results.

### Combining Searches
You can search for multiple terms or phrases in a single query via `q="term1 term2 term3"`
Also you can require or allow a phrase using `+` prefix in a term and `-` prefix to disallow a term

### Example Queries
- Searching for all documents: `q=*:*`
- Searching for documents within a specific field: `q=cat:electronics`
- Searching for a multi-term phrase: `q=CAS%20latency`
- Searching for documents containing *electronics* phrase and disallow *music* phrase`q=+electronics%20-music`
- Searching for documents containing *electronics* phrase and disallow *music* phrase in `cat` field `q=cat:+electronics%20-music`
  
`%20` represents a space in url encoding.

## Fetching sorted data
We can retrieve the sorted result using `sort` parameter and giving it the field where we want to apply the sorting. Also we can apply ascending or descending order filter. To do this add a space and write `asc` for ascending order and `desc` for descending order.
Add this parameter
```bash
&sort=<Field Name>%20desc
```
> **Note:** Sorting on multi-valued fields does not work. However, a common solution to this issue is to use a copyField directive to create a new single-valued field that contains a sorted, concatenated version of the multi-valued field's values. For example if customer_name is a multivalued, you can use customer_name_str copy field for sorting. We will cover copy field in detail in Schema.md.

## Comparative conditions
These conditions are used to compare the values of fields in documents. This can involve comparing a field's value to a specified constant or to another field's value. Solr supports various types of comparative conditions, including:

- **Equal To (`:`)**: Matches documents where the field value is equal to the specified value.
  Example: `status:ORDER_COMPLETED`

- **Not Equal To (`NOT` or `-`)**: Matches documents where the field value is not equal to the specified value.
  Examples:
  - `-status:ORDER_COMPLETED` (Fetch the orders where status is not ORDER_COMPLETED)
  - `q=status:ORDER_COMPLETED NOT category:electronics` (Fetch the orders where status is ORDER_COMPLETED and category is not electronics)


- **Greater Than (`>`)**: Matches documents where the field value is greater than the specified value.
  Example: `price:{10 TO *}`.
> **Note:** In Solr queries, the * is a wildcard character that represents any value. When used in a range query like {10 TO *}, it means "from 10 to any value." So, the query {10 TO *} would match documents where the field value is 10 or greater, means 10 is inclusive.

- **Less Than (`<`)**: Matches documents where the field value is less than the specified value.
  Example: `price:{* TO 100}`

- **Range Queries (`{TO}`)**: Matches documents where the field value falls within the specified range.
  Example: `price:{10 TO 100}`

These comparative conditions can be combined using logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) and can be grouped using parentheses to create complex queries.

## `AND` and `OR` Conditions
To retrieve documents based on multiple conditions, you can use the `AND` and `OR` operators between different conditions.
For example, to retrieve orders with `status=ORDER_COMPLETED` and `PRODUCT_ID=100` use this syntax:
```plaintext
  http://localhost:8983/solr/<Collection Name>/select?q=status:ORDER_COMPLETED AND PRODUCT_ID:100
```


Similarly you can create a hierarchy of conditions as well. For example this query retrieves documents where the status is ORDER_COMPLETED, and either the PRODUCT_ID is 100 or the CATEGORY is Electronics, and the PRICE is between 10 and 100 or the RATING is greater than or equal to 3.
```plaintext
http://localhost:8983/solr/<Collection Name>/select?q=status:ORDER_COMPLETED AND (PRODUCT_ID:100 OR CATEGORY:Electronics) AND (PRICE:{10 TO 100} OR RATING:[3 TO *])
```

Like this we can create a hierarchy of conditions. For example:
```plaintext
http://localhost:8983/solr/<Collection Name>/select?q=status:ORDER_COMPLETED AND (PRODUCT_ID:100 OR CATEGORY:Electronics) AND (PRICE:{10 TO 100} OR RATING:[3 TO *])
```
