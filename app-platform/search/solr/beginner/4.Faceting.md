## Faceting 

Faceting is a powerful feature in Solr that allows search results to be organized into subsets or categories, with counts provided for each subset. Solr supports several types of faceting, including field facets, range facets, and pivot facets.

### Field Facets

Field facets provide counts for each unique value of a specified field in the result set. By enabling faceting and specifying the field to facet on, users can retrieve facet counts from all documents in the index. To enable field facets, the following parameters are required:
- `&rows=0` (We set rows=0 to retrieve facet counts without fetching the actual documents, optimizing performance by avoiding unnecessary document retrieval)
- `&facet=true`
- `&facet.field={Target Field Name}`

**Example**
- `&facet.field=order_type`
  
This query will result the count of each type of order.

### Range Facets

Range facets are used for numeric or date fields, allowing users to partition facet counts into ranges rather than discrete values. To enable range facets, users should include parameters such as:
- `&rows=0`
- `&facet=true`
- `&facet.range={Numeric or Date Field}`
- `&facet.range.start={Start Value}`
- `&facet.range.end={End Value}`
- `&facet.range.gap={Gap between Ranges}`
  
**Example**
- `&facet.range=order_date`
- `&facet.range.start=2000-01-01`
- `&facet.range.end={2024-02-22 || NOW (means till now)}`
- `&facet.range.gap=%2B1YEAR`

This query will result in range facet counts for the "order_date" field, starting from January 1, 2000, ending at the current date, and grouped by year. That means the query will count the total number of orders for each year


### Pivot Facets

Pivot facets, also known as decision trees, enable nesting two or more fields to explore various combinations. With pivot faceting, users can analyze how different fields intersect within the result set. To enable pivot facets, you should include parameters such as:
- `&rows=0`
- `&facet=true`
- `&facet.pivot={Field1,Field2,...}`
- `&facet.pivot.mincount={Minimum Count}`
- `&facet.pivot.limit={Maximum Number of Pivot Facets}`
  
**Example**
- `&facet.pivot=userId,productId`
- `&facet.pivot.mincount=2`
- `&facet.pivot.limit=10`
  
It will result in combinations of users and products where each combination has occurred at least twice, limited to the top 10 combinations. This query will give information about the number of times each user has purchased each product.

Faceting in Solr offers valuable insights into the composition and distribution of data within search results, empowering users to explore and analyze their datasets effectively.
